                  A carpooling app for parents/guardians doing school runs to
                  common destinations. Reduces fuel costs, traffic congestion
                  and carbon emmissions. As a parent, I want to book a ride
                  ahead of time for my children so they arrive at their
                  destination within a defined time window. I want the app to
                  store my default information so that I can minimize re-entry.
                  I want to be able to book rides on my mobile phone or desktop
                  computer. As a driver (parent of other children) I want to be
                  able to chose what rides I accept. When I accept a drive
                  request I want the app to tell me how much earlier I need to
                  leave and provide a route for all of my pickups. I want to be
                  able to accept rides on my mobile phone or desktop computer.
